# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing kickstarter data to gain insight into their outcomes.

## Introduction

Crowdfunding projects can be sucessful or fail. What informs thier final outcomes is key to future exercises.
This project invloved the use of Excel to analyze data from crowdfunding projects in 21 countries to unravel possible key indicators that contributed to their outcomes.
The information revealed from the analysis is narrowed down to provide insight into why some theatre productions succeeded and others not.

### Findings

1. Location
The analysis proves that the setting for a project contributes to its success. Threatre production in Great Britain was more successful than that in the United States.
We can deduce that the audience in Great Britain is inclined to threatre especially plays which was a more successful subcategory.

2. Time
A quick analysis of the time a campaign is lunched also provides interesting information on its outcomes.

A look at the line chart showing the datapoints for outcomes per lunch dates indicates that funding for theater events was more sucessful in the months of May to July. However the month of May was more suitable for funding as having the highest level of success per the chart. Ironically the same month also recorded the highest number of failed campaigns for theatre, with a difference of 2 projects from that of July and October who recorded the same number of failed projects.

3. Fundraising Goal
The analysis of the data from pledges, backers and goals for kickstarters draw insight into how such relationship affect their outcomes.
A measure of central tendency on the data shows that campaigns with high fundraising goals attracted less backers hence low pledges and this resulted in their inability to take off. From the data the average pledge of successful campaigns was slightly more than their average goals. An indication that campaigns with reasonalble fundraising goals received corresponding pledges. 

#### Conclusion
To conclude its evident from the analysis that the best outcome for a kickstarter campaign for a theatre production will be to have a funding goal set within reasonalble limits. A higher goal might attract less than proportionate pledge and ruin the campaign.
The location of the campaign cannot be overlooked aswell. Audience is key since some locations had a higher rate of funding than the others. 
The time setting is also critical for the success of the campaign. Its evident that the more successful months of lunching a campaign was in the summer. 
##### Recommendation
- With a budget of $10,000 Louise goal is twice that of sucessful campaigns and should consider revising that goal. 
- The most successful time to lunch her campaign should be in Summer, preferably in May which recorded the highest number of suncessful campaigns.
